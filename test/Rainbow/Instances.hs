-- | QuickCheck instances for all of Rainbow.  Currently Rainbow does
-- not use these instances itself; they are only here for
-- cut-and-paste for other libraries that may need them.  There is an
-- executable in Rainbow that is built solely to make sure this module
-- compiles without any errors.
--
-- To use these instances, just drop them into your own project
-- somewhere.  They are not packaged as a library because there are
-- orphan instances.
